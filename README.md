# Bus Finder App

Best viewed in the latest version of Chrome.

This app uses _geolocation_â€”to use all functionality, please enable geolocation in your browser.

As a security measure, Chrome doesn't allow geolocation when running index.html locally in the browser. 
	
To use the site with geolocation, make sure you're in the site directory in your terminal and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. The default port is 8000.

Open Chrome and navigate to `localhost:8000`.
